*THIS MAY NOT WORK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.*
But in all seriousness, this is Team Rush 27's version of 2713's QRScout app, optimized for our scouting methods.
This app utilises an FPS-Time Scoring system where a team's Fuel Per Second is multiplied by the time they were scoring.
Changes from the original app (useful if creating your own version):
1. There are now 2 types of counters: one for Integer values (type: int), and one for decimal values to the tenths place (type: dec)
/n
This list will be updated as the app progresses.
So yeah, that's all I have to say about this.
